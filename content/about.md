### Assessment. Validity. Technology.

My academic journey began with a foundation in the human side of learning through my studies in Psychological Counseling and Guidance. This perspective sparked a deeper question that has since guided my career: How can we more accurately, fairly, and effectively understand and measure educational progress? This inquiry led me to the quantitative and analytical field of Educational Measurement and Evaluation at Hacettepe University, where I have pursued both my Master's and doctoral degrees.

During my studies, I specialized in the intersection of modern psychometrics and technology. My work is driven by the conviction that the future of meaningful assessment lies in leveraging computational tools. I focus on applying machine learning and AI to interrogate complex assessment data, aiming not only to enhance predictive accuracy but also to uncover novel forms of validity evidence that traditional methods might miss. This commitment is about improving the efficiency and equity of how we measure knowledge and skills.

As a Research Assistant at Ba≈ükent University, I am actively engaged in the academic community while advancing my Ph.D. research. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of next-generation assessment models that are more adaptive and insightful. I am particularly interested in how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be responsibly harnessed to create more authentic and equitable evaluation tools for a new generation of learners.
